## WebSocket

### Account channel

Retrieve account information. Data will be pushed when triggered by events such as placing order, canceling order, transaction execution, etc.
It will also be pushed in regular interval according to subscription granularity.

Concurrent connection to this channel will be restricted by the following rules: [WebSocket connection count limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit).

"" will be returned for inapplicable fields under the current account level.



 - The account data is sent on event basis and regular basis.

 - The event push is not pushed in real-time. It is aggregated and pushed at a fixed time interval, around 50ms. For example, if multiple events occur within a fixed time interval, the system will aggregate them into a single message and push it at the end of the fixed time interval. If the data volume is too large, it may be split into multiple messages.

 - The regular push sends updates regardless of whether there are activities in the trading account or not.



 - Only currencies with non-zero balance will be pushed. Definition of non-zero balance: any value of eq, availEq, availBal parameters is not 0. If the data is too large to be sent in a single push message, it will be split into multiple messages.

 - For example, when subscribing to account channel without specifying ccy and there are 5 currencies are with non-zero balance, all 5 currencies data will be pushed in initial snapshot and in regular update. Subsequently when there is change in balance or equity of an token, only the incremental data of that currency will be pushed triggered by this change.

### Positions channel

Retrieve position information. Initial snapshot will be pushed according to subscription granularity. Data will be pushed when triggered by events such as placing/canceling order, and will also be pushed in regular interval according to subscription granularity.

Concurrent connection to this channel will be restricted by the following rules: [WebSocket connection count limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit).

 - The position data is sent on event basis and regular basis

 - The event push is not pushed in real-time. It is aggregated and pushed at a fixed time interval, around 50ms. For example, if multiple events occur within a fixed time interval, the system will aggregate them into a single message and push it at the end of the fixed time interval. If the data volume is too large, it may be split into multiple messages.

 - The regular push sends updates regardless of whether there are position activities or not.

 - If an event push and a regular push happen at the same time, the system will send the event push first, followed by the regular push.

As for portfolio margin account, the IMR and MMR of the position are calculated in risk unit granularity, thus their values of the same risk unit cross positions are the same.

In the position-by-position trading setting, it is an autonomous transfer mode. After the margin is transferred, positions with a position of 0 will be pushed



 - Only position with non-zero position quantity will be pushed. Definition of non-zero quantity: value of pos parameter is not 0. If the data is too large to be sent in a single push message, it will be split into multiple messages.

 - For example, when subscribing to positions channel specifying an underlying and there are 20 positions are with non-zero quantity, all 20 positions data will be pushed in initial snapshot and in regular push. Subsequently when there is change in pos of a position, only the data of that position will be pushed triggered by this change.

Unlike futures contracts, option positions are automatically exercised or expire at maturity. The rights then terminate and no closing orders are generated. Therefore, this channel will not push any updates for expired option positions.

### Balance and position channel

Retrieve account balance and position information. Data will be pushed when triggered by events such as filled order, funding transfer.

This channel applies to getting the account cash balance and the change of position asset ASAP.

Concurrent connection to this channel will be restricted by the following rules: [WebSocket connection count limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit).

Only balData will be pushed if only the account balance changes; only posData will be pushed if only the position changes.




 - Initial snapshot: Only either position with non-zero position quantity or cash balance with non-zero quantity will be pushed. If the data is too large to be sent in a single push message, it will be split into multiple messages.

 - For example, if you subscribe according to all currencies and the user has 5 currency balances that are not 0 and 20 positions, all 20 positions data and 5 currency balances data will be pushed in initial snapshot; Subsequently when there is change in pos of a position, only the data of that position will be pushed triggered by this change.


### Position risk warning

This push channel is only used as a risk warning, and is not recommended as a risk judgment for strategic trading

In the case that the market is volatile, there may be the possibility that the position has been liquidated at the same time that this message is pushed.

The warning is sent when a position is at risk of liquidation for isolated margin positions. The warning is sent when all the positions are at risk of liquidation for cross-margin positions.

Concurrent connection to this channel will be restricted by the following rules: [WebSocket connection count limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit).

Trigger push logic: the trigger logic of the liquidation warning and the liquidation message is the same

and will also be pushed in regular interval according to subscription granularity.

#### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | String | No | Unique identifier of the message Provided by client. It will be returned in response message for identifying the corresponding request. A combination of case-sensitive alphanumerics, all numbers, or all letters of up to 32 characters. |
| op | String | Yes | Operation`subscribe` `unsubscribe` |
| args | Array of objects | Yes | List of subscribed channels |
| > channel | String | Yes | Channel name`account-greeks` |
| > ccy | String | No | Settlement currencyWhen the user specifies a settlement currency, event push will only be triggered when the position of the same settlement currency changes. For example, when ccy=BTC, if the position of `BTC-USDT-SWAP` changes, no event push will be triggered. |

The account greeks data is sent on event basis and regular basis

 - The event push is not pushed in real-time. It is aggregated and pushed at a fixed time interval, around 50ms. For example, if multiple events occur within a fixed time interval, the system will aggregate them into a single message and push it at the end of the fixed time interval. If the data volume is too large, it may be split into multiple messages.

 - When the user specifies a settlement currency in the subscribe request, event push will only be triggered when the position of the same settlement currency changes. For example, when subscribe `ccy`=BTC, if the position of `BTC-USDT-SWAP` changes, no event push will be triggered.

 - The regular push sends updates regardless of whether there are activities or not.




 - Only currencies in the account will be pushed. If the data is too large to be sent in a single push message, it will be split into multiple messages.

 - For example, when subscribing to account-greeks channel without specifying ccy and there are 5 currencies are with non-zero balance, all 5 currencies data will be pushed in initial snapshot and in regular interval. Subsequently when there is change in balance or equity of an token, only the incremental data of that currency will be pushed triggered by this change.
