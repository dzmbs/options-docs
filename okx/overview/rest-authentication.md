## REST Authentication

### Making Requests

All private REST requests must contain the following headers:

- `OK-ACCESS-KEY` The API key as a String.

- `OK-ACCESS-SIGN` The Base64-encoded signature (see Signing Messages subsection for details).

- `OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP` The UTC timestamp of your request .e.g : 2020-12-08T09:08:57.715Z

- `OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE` The passphrase you specified when creating the API key.

Request bodies should have content type `application/json` and be in valid JSON format.

### Signature

Signing Messages

The `OK-ACCESS-SIGN` header is generated as follows:

- Create a pre-hash string of timestamp + method + requestPath + body (where + represents String concatenation).

- Prepare the SecretKey.

- Sign the pre-hash string with the SecretKey using the HMAC SHA256.

- Encode the signature in the Base64 format.

Example: `sign=CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(timestamp + 'GET' + '/api/v5/account/balance?ccy=BTC', SecretKey))`

The `timestamp` value is the same as the `OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP` header with millisecond ISO format, e.g. `2020-12-08T09:08:57.715Z`.

The request method should be in UPPERCASE: e.g. `GET` and `POST`.

The `requestPath` is the path of requesting an endpoint.

Example: `/api/v5/account/balance`

The `body` refers to the String of the request body. It can be omitted if there is no request body (frequently the case for `GET` requests).

Example: `{"instId":"BTC-USDT","lever":"5","mgnMode":"isolated"}`

`GET` request parameters are counted as requestpath, not body

The SecretKey is generated when you create an API key.

Example: `22582BD0CFF14C41EDBF1AB98506286D`
